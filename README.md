1.5 Wait for the installation to complete

2. First-time Setup:
   - After installing VS Code, what initial configurations and settings should be adjusted for an optimal coding environment? Mention any important settings or extensions.
After installing VS Code, consider the following initial configurations for an optimal coding environment:
2.1 Install essential extensions: Open the Extensions view (⇧⌘X (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+X)) and search for extensions like "Live Server", "Prettier", and "ESLint". Install them to enhance your development workflow.
2.2 Adjust font size and theme: Open the Command Palette (⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P)) and search for "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)". In the settings.json file, add the following lines to change the font size and theme:
2.3 Enable Auto Save: In the Command Palette, search for "Preferences: Open Settings (UI)". In the settings editor, search for "Auto Save" and enable it.

  The Command Palette is a searchable menu that provides access to nearly all VS Code features and commands. Press ⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P) to open it. Some common tasks you can perform using the Command Palette include:
4.1 Changing the theme
4.2 Configuring user and workspace settings
4.3 Searching for and running commands
4.4 Accessing recently used files 

5. Extensions in VS Code:
   - Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.
   Extensions in VS Code allow you to add new features, themes, and integrations to the editor. To find and install extensions:
5.1 Open the Extensions view (⇧⌘X (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+X)).
5.2 Search for the extension you want to install (e.g., "Live Server", "Prettier", "ESLint").
5.3 Click on the extension and select "Install".
Some essential extensions for web development include:

5.1.2 Prettier: Automatically formats your code.
5.1.3 ESLint: Integrates ESLint into VS Code

6. Integrated Terminal:
   - Describe how to open and use the integrated terminal in VS Code. What are the advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal?
To open the integrated terminal in VS Code, press ` (backtick) or use the Command Palette to search for "Terminal: Create New Terminal". The integrated terminal allows you to run shell commands without leaving VS Code, making it convenient for tasks like running scripts, installing packages, and navigating the file system

7. File and Folder Management:
   - Explain how to create, open, and manage files and folders in VS Code. How can users navigate between different files and directories efficiently?
To create a new file or folder, right-click in the Explorer view and select "New File" or "New Folder". To open a file, double-click on it in the Explorer view. You can navigate between open files using the tabs at the top of the Editor Group.
To quickly switch between files, use the Quick Open feature by pressing ⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+P) and start typing the file name

8. Settings and Preferences:
   - Where can users find and customize settings in VS Code? Provide examples of how to change the theme, font size, and keybindings.

You can customize VS Code settings by opening the Command Palette and searching for "Preferences: Open Settings (UI)" or "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)". The settings editor allows you to search and modify settings, while the settings.json file provides a text-based interface for advanced configurations.

To change the theme, font size, and keybindings:

9.3 Update the launch.json file with the appropriate configuration for your project.
9.4 Press F5 or click the Debug icon in the Activity Bar to start debugging.

Some key debugging features in VS Code include breakpoints, call stacks, variables, and the Debug Console.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

 To integrate Git with VS Code for version control:
